Summary
=======

This software can be used to reproduce the results in our "SimplE Embedding for Link Prediction in Knowledge Graphs" paper. It can be also used to learn `SimplE` models for other datasets. The software can be also used as a framework to implement new tensor factorization models (implementations for `TransE` and `ComplEx` are included as two examples).

## Dependencies
[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fcarsonkahn-volley%2FSimplE.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fcarsonkahn-volley%2FSimplE?ref=badge_shield)


* `Python` version 2.7 or higher
* `Numpy` version 1.13.1 or higher
* `Tensorflow` version 1.1.0 or higher

## Usage

To run a model `M` on a dataset `D`, do the following steps:
* `cd` to the directory where `main.py` is
* Run `python main.py -m M -d D`

Examples (commands start after $):

    $ python main.py -m SimplE_ignr -d wn18
    $ python main.py -m SimplE_avg -d fb15k
    $ python main.py -m ComplEx -d wn18

Running a model `M` on a dataset `D` will save the embeddings in a folder with the following address:

    $ <Current Directory>/M_weights/D/

As an example, running the `SimplE_ignr` model on `wn18` will save the embeddings in the following folder:

    $ <Current Directory>/SimplE_ignr_weights/wn18/

## Learned Embeddings for SimplE

The best embeddings learned for `SimplE_ignr` and `SimplE_avg` on `wn18` and `fb15k` can be downloaded from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fSxdFbSIcS4w4mAHUhKewjmXCcbOGqM7/view?usp=sharing) and [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hpDS34BxNfbr6xGeut5q5nvx8fW98qCe/view?usp=sharing) respectively.

To use these embeddings, place them in the same folder as `main.py`, load the embeddings and use them.
